# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Python client library for interacting with InvokeAI APIs. The project provides a Pythonic interface over selected InvokeAI capabilities, focusing on common tasks like workflow execution, asset management, and job tracking.

**Current Status**: Repository pattern implementation complete for both boards and workflows. Board subsystem refactored with BoardHandle pattern. Workflow subsystem partially implemented, field types stubbed but not implemented.

## Development Commands

### Using Pixi (recommended for conda environments)
```bash
# Development setup
pixi run dev-setup        # Install editable package and pre-commit hooks
pixi run quality          # Run all quality checks (lint, typecheck, test)

# Code quality
pixi run lint             # Check code with ruff
pixi run lint-fix         # Fix linting issues
pixi run format           # Format code with ruff
pixi run typecheck        # Type check with mypy

# Testing
pixi run test             # Run tests with pytest
pixi run test-cov         # Run tests with coverage report

# Documentation
pixi run docs-serve       # Serve documentation locally
pixi run docs-build       # Build documentation
```

### Using standard Python tools
```bash
# Installation
pip install -e .                  # Install in development mode
pip install -e ".[dev]"           # Install with dev dependencies

# Testing
python -m pytest tests/ -v        # Run tests verbosely
python -m pytest tests/test_boards.py::TestBoardRepo::test_list_boards  # Run single test

# Code quality
python -m ruff check src/ tests/  # Lint code
python -m ruff format src/ tests/ # Format code
python -m mypy src/               # Type checking
```

## Architecture & Design Patterns

### Repository Pattern Architecture
The client uses a Repository pattern to separate concerns:
- **InvokeAIClient**: Main client class, manages connection and high-level operations
- **BoardRepository**: Manages board lifecycle and creates BoardHandle instances
- **BoardHandle**: Represents running state of a board, handles image operations
- **WorkflowRepository**: Manages workflow lifecycle and creates WorkflowHandle instances
- **WorkflowHandle**: Represents running state of a workflow, handles execution

Example usage flow:
```python
client = InvokeAIClient("localhost", 9090)

# Board operations through handle
board_handle = client.board_repo.create_board("My Art")
board_handle.upload_image("photo.png")
images = board_handle.list_images()

# Workflow operations through handle
workflow = client.create_workflow(workflow_def)
workflow.get_input(0).field.value = "prompt"
job = workflow.submit_sync()
```

### Workflow Subsystem Design
Workflows support dual naming systems for inputs:
- **System names**: `{node_id}.{field_name}` - Always unique, guaranteed to work
- **User names**: Simple field names - May collide, raises ValueError when ambiguous

Key workflow components:
- **WorkflowDefinition**: Pydantic model for workflow JSON structure
- **InkWorkflowInput**: Data model containing field metadata and typed field instance
- **Ink* Field Types**: Type-safe field models with Pydantic validation (InkStringField, InkImageField, etc.)

### Field Type System
Field types follow a consistent pattern with abstract base class:
- All fields inherit from `Field[T]` generic base class
- Each field implements: `validate()`, `to_api_format()`, `from_api_format()`
- Heavy data (images, models) use reference names, not actual data
- Validation happens at two levels: per-field and workflow-level

### Data Models (Pydantic)
All API interactions use Pydantic models for type safety:
- **Board**: Board management with special "none" board_id for uncategorized
- **IvkImage, IvkJob**: Image and job tracking
- **WorkflowDefinition**: Workflow structure from JSON
- **Enums**: JobStatus, ImageCategory, BaseModelEnum

## Key Implementation Details

### Uncategorized Board Handling
The uncategorized board uses string "none" as board_id (not Python None) because:
- InvokeAI API expects literal "none" in URL paths: `/api/v1/boards/none/image_names`
- Python None would serialize to null in JSON, unusable in URL paths

### Workflow Input Resolution
When loading workflows, the client must:
1. Parse the workflow JSON's "exposedFields" section
2. Create InkWorkflowInput instances for each exposed field
3. Handle potential naming conflicts between nodes
4. Provide both system and user name access methods

### Heavy Data Management
Images and models are handled by reference:
- Upload returns a name/ID from InvokeAI backend
- Workflows reference data by these names
- After execution, explicitly delete uploaded assets to free space

## Testing & API Reference

### InvokeAI Test Server
- Default: `http://localhost:9090`
- API version: `/api/v1`
- OpenAPI spec: `context/hints/invokeai-kb/invokeai-openapi.json`

### Test Data Locations
- Example workflows: `data/workflows/` (SDXL, FLUX templates)
- API call examples: `data/api-calls/` (request payloads)
- Demo scripts: `examples/` (working API demonstrations)

### Key API Patterns
```python
# Board operations use Repository pattern
boards = client.board_repo.list_boards()
board = client.board_repo.get_board_by_id(board_id)

# Workflow execution flow
workflow = client.create_workflow(workflow_def)
inputs = workflow.list_inputs()  # Returns List[InkWorkflowInput]
workflow.set_input("prompt", "A beautiful landscape")
job = workflow.submit_sync()
results = workflow.wait_for_completion_sync()
```

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed
- Repository pattern for boards (BoardRepository)
- Pydantic models for core entities
- Board/image management APIs
- Project configuration (pyproject.toml with pixi integration)

### ðŸš§ In Progress
- Workflow class methods (all NotImplementedError)
- Field type implementations (base classes exist, methods not implemented)
- WorkflowRepository pattern

### ðŸ“‹ Next Steps (from task-impl-2.md)
1. Implement WorkflowRepository following BoardRepository pattern
2. Create InkWorkflowInput and field type models
3. Implement workflow submission and job tracking
4. Add asset cleanup after workflow completion
5. Write comprehensive tests for all components

## Important Constraints

- **No file creation**: Only edit existing files unless absolutely necessary
- **No documentation files**: Don't create *.md files unless explicitly requested
- **Repository pattern**: All resource management through repository classes
- **Type safety**: Use Pydantic models for all API data
- **Dual naming**: Support both system and user names for workflow inputs
