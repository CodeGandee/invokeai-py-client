# Reference Code Directory

Store reference implementations, code examples, and third-party integrations that serve as patterns for new development.

## Purpose
This directory contains reference implementations, code examples, and integration patterns for the invokeai-py-client project that serve as templates for new development.

## Content Types
- Reference implementations of key features
- Third-party API integration examples
- Code patterns and best practices
- Sample applications and use cases
- External library usage examples
- Performance benchmarking code

## Naming Conventions
Use descriptive names that indicate the reference type:
- `api-client-pattern.py`
- `async-request-handling.py`
- `error-handling-best-practices.py`
- `authentication-flow-example.py`
- `image-processing-pipeline.py`

## Document Format
Code files should include:
- Clear docstrings explaining the purpose
- Comments explaining key implementation decisions
- Example usage and test cases
- Performance considerations
- Dependencies and requirements

## Organization
- Create subdirectories for different categories
- Include accompanying `.md` files explaining the code
- Reference external sources and documentation
- Note version compatibility and update requirements

## Usage
These references should be consulted when implementing similar functionality to ensure consistency and leverage proven patterns.
