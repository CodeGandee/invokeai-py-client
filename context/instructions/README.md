# Instructions Directory

Store reusable prompt snippets, command templates, and standardized instruction patterns that can be referenced across the project. Useful for maintaining consistency in AI interactions.

## Purpose
This directory contains reusable prompt snippets, command templates, and standardized instruction patterns for consistent AI interactions throughout the invokeai-py-client project.

## Content Types
- Reusable prompt templates for common tasks
- Command templates and snippets
- Standardized instruction patterns
- Code review templates
- Documentation templates

## Naming Conventions
Use command or snippet type prefixes:
- `prompt-code-review-template.md`
- `command-git-workflow.md`
- `snippet-error-handling-pattern.md`
- `template-feature-documentation.md`
- `prompt-api-testing.md`

## Document Format
Each document should include a HEADER section with:
- **Purpose**: What this instruction template is for
- **Status**: Current state (active/deprecated/needs-update)
- **Date**: When created or last updated
- **Dependencies**: What context or tools this requires
- **Target**: Intended audience (AI assistants, developers, etc.)

## Usage
These templates can be referenced in conversations with AI assistants to maintain consistency in project workflows and outputs.
