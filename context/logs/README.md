# Logs Directory

Record development sessions with date prefixes and outcome status. Include both successful implementations and failed attempts with lessons learned.

## Purpose
This directory maintains a chronological record of development sessions, implementations, and outcomes for the invokeai-py-client project.

## Content Types
- Development session records
- Implementation attempts (successful and failed)
- Bug fix sessions
- Performance optimization efforts
- Deployment and release logs
- Learning outcomes and insights

## Naming Conventions
Use date prefix with descriptive outcome:
- `YYYY-MM-DD_feature-name-implementation-success.md`
- `YYYY-MM-DD_bug-fix-attempt-failed.md`
- `YYYY-MM-DD_performance-optimization-complete.md`
- `YYYY-MM-DD_api-integration-testing-session.md`

## Document Format
Each log should include a HEADER section with:
- **Purpose**: What was attempted or implemented
- **Status**: Final outcome (success/failed/partial/ongoing)
- **Date**: Session date
- **Dependencies**: What was required or used
- **Target**: Team members, future developers, AI assistants

## Best Practices
- Record both successes and failures for learning
- Include code snippets, error messages, and solutions
- Note time spent and blockers encountered
- Document lessons learned for future reference
