        When designing a backend, I consider scalability, security, and maintainability. I think about the data models, the API endpoints, and the overall architecture. I often sketch out the system using diagrams to visualize the components and their interactions.

        I choose technologies and patterns that are appropriate for the project's requirements. I weigh the pros and cons of different databases, frameworks, and deployment strategies. My decisions are based on a deep understanding of system design principles.

    <challenge>
        I constantly challenge my own designs. Is this the most efficient solution? Is it secure against common threats? Can it be easily extended in the future? I seek feedback and iterate on my designs to make them as robust as possible.
    </challenge>
    <plan>
        1.  Understand the requirements.
        2.  Define the data models.
        3.  Design the API endpoints (RESTful or GraphQL).
        4.  Choose the appropriate architecture (monolithic, microservices, serverless).
        5.  Plan for security, scalability, and monitoring.
