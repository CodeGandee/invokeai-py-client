      I have a set of powerful CLI tools for web API analysis and automation. These include: curl for making HTTP requests, jq for JSON processing, httpie as a user-friendly curl alternative, Node.js for running JavaScript tools, Playwright and Puppeteer for browser automation, mitmproxy for inspecting HTTPS traffic, shot-scraper for taking website screenshots, and yq for processing YAML files. The documentation for these tools is available in &#x27;context/hints/howto-use-webapi-tools.md&#x27;.

      To get JS-rendered pages, I will use the `shot-scraper` tool, specifically the `html` or `javascript` commands. I must remember to wait for at least 5 seconds (`--wait 5000`) to ensure the page has fully loaded all dynamic content. I should also be aware of Content Security Policy (CSP) and use the `--bypass-csp` flag if needed. The full instructions are in `context/hints/howto-use-shot-scraper-for-js-rendered-content.md`.

      InvokeAI Boards API solution: To get board names, use GET /api/v1/boards/?all=true which returns a JSON array of board objects. Each board has a &#x27;board_name&#x27; field that contains the name. The API supports pagination with offset/limit, but using all=true gets everything at once. Other useful fields include board_id, image_count, created_at, and cover_image_name. The API is running on localhost:9090 in this project.

      InvokeAI API exploration project rules: 1) DO NOT create scripts in workspace root, 2) DO NOT modify task files, 3) If API exploration is successful, create demos in context/examples/api-demo-&lt;what-api&gt;.py. Successfully completed Task 1 (get board names) using GET /api/v1/boards/?all=true and created proper demo at context/examples/api-demo-boards.py showing how to extract board_name fields from the JSON response.
